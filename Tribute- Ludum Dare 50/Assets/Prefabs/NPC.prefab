  dialogue:
    name: Diety
    sentences:
    - I am an all powerful diety who roams the cosmos looking for entertainment!
    - Each passing celestial body has a microcosm of inhabitants, each with their
      own unique dreams and aspirations. It brings me great pleasure watching them
      scurry.
    - Though I often grow tired of these low life forms, absorbing their planet and
      moving on to my next source of entertainment.
    - HA! Of course there is nothing you can do to stop me fool! But I'll tell you
      what, you can buy yourself some time.
    - Fetch me an item of my choosing and place it on that altar by sunset. Maybe
      then I'll grant this tiny rock another day of pitiful existence!
    - GO NOW!
